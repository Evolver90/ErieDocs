Dear Bishop Waltham,


I am writing to give my report regarding our inquest into the persistent superstitions that the Erie patrish has been haunted.  I'm well aware of his excellency's stance on such things, but I'm afraid to report that there may be something to the rumors here.


As you know, last August Mr. Gaston Muircastle murdered his family, then killed himself.  The children were taken to the hospital and attempts were made to save their lives, but were fruitless.  Subsequently the staff refused to enter the room, and one of the nurses committed suicide.  The room was sealed and locked, and I feel that it may be one of the sources of the persistent rumors.


For that reason, I've been working to get in there, but all my attempts thus far have been fruitless.  Dr. Steiner, the attending physician, has transferred to Savannah General Hospital and thus far has refused to return my calls regarding the room.  I did, however, discover that he hid the key to the room near the old lighthouse, and I went there in an attempt to retrieve it.  


Unfortunately, moments after I retrieved the key I was set upon by what could only be described as ... phantoms. I almost felt as if I was in a living nightmare, and I've not been able to sleep or even think since.  The cathedral was alive with noise last night, including the sounds of screaming children which I can only think must be the Muircastle children. I finally collapsed and when I awoke, the key was gone.


I'm terribly afraid that the key is now in the Muircastle Mansion, and frankly I'm quite terrified to go there.  However, I will do so early tomorrow morning before Mass and attempt to find the key.  I'll update this letter in the morning with the results and will post this on Monday.
