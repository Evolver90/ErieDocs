The Orb of  Power is an ancient and cursed artifact which has the power to give near invincibility to its posessor.  It was sought for many years by the Muircastle trust and others because of the incredibly power it can grant.


Be cautioned however.  The Orb's gifts are not limitless. After use, it must be recharged, and that takes a considerable anount of time.  Additionally, no one knows the exact number, but once it has been used too many times by an individual, it can only bring them harm.


If you hold the orb, caution is recommended.  If you are stealing it, even greater caution is necessary, for it may betray you when least expected.
