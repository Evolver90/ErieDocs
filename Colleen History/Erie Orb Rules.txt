There are 3 items hidden around the sim - click them to get a notecard with details of who and what is needed to complete the ritual to help destroy the orb.


The rules:


1. GMs can assist, but can't participate and won't give direct hints
2. To win the reward, you'll need to:
    a) find the clues
    b) find the necessary ingredients
    c) Roleplay collecting the needed people
    d) Put together and conduct the needed ritual (let a gm know when and where this is going to happen)
    
    
This will take a significant amount of time and roleplay, and therefore has a significant XP reward:


1) If an individual player completes all the nececessary steps, they'll be given a complete level, plus a 1 week free stay in the Erie apartments
2) If a team does it, they'll each be rewarded 1000xp, plus each member of the team will get a week free in one of the apartments


Please remember to notecard the roleplay along the way, we'll need that for the xp reward.  and good luck!
