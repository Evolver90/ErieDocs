Haunted: 
Inside the chest, you find a stack of old-fashioned photographs which appear to have been taken in the early 20th century.


Included with them is a letter.  Everything in the box is covered in a thick layer of dust.


June 1, 1932


Dear Margaret,


I'm headed to the post office  in just a little while to send the photos to you.  I'm afraid something terrible has happened.  You remember Laura? I'm terribly sorry to tell you that last night she... passed away.  At her own hand.  She'd told me this crazy story that she was being haunted of all things.  I wasn't terribly sympathetic... I had no idea she was this serious.  


I'm ... devastated to be honest... I feel somehow that it is my fault.  I'm very very sorry.


Then... in the middle of the night ... there was a pounding on the door... but when I went to the door... nobody was there.


Anyway... I'll head out shortly and post the photos, and ... I hope to see you soon.


Yours forever,


Robert
