Erie Island? Yeah, it was a great place to visit.


Years ago, people used to come from near and far to visit this quiet little place. Shopping, a great club, and beautiful scenery…you would be hard pressed to find a more beautiful vacation spot. Mom had an apartment over in the complex, it’s mine now. Was a shame when things started changing…
A few years ago, the weather patterns shifted. Violent storms raged, hurricanes, rain, and floods. No one knew quite what to make of it, but you can’t have a vacation resort when it rains all the time. Then, the real oddness began. Bodies found half eaten, people going mad, strange noises in the night. You see, this place is, one giant…’tween. Yeah, like the kids stories, it’s an in between. In between what you ask?  Life, and death.
See, Erie Island is haunted. And no, it isn’t the go bump in the night, scare the kids with bedtime stories haunted. It’s the spirits of the past wanting things…revenge, advice, aid. The ghosts here…yes, I said ghosts…get used to it if you’re going to stick around for a while…are a power unto themselves. The dead come to meet the living here, and usually quite violently. 


Sigh.


Of course, humans are the last to know such things.
Other beings, seem to be drawn to it, like a moth to flame. Lycans, Vampirs, Demons, Angels…they are all here with their own stories…trying to help, trying to harm. Don’t see them you say? Well, you don’t see them anywhere else either, doesn’t mean they aren’t around.  See, while humans aren’t that quick on the uptake, there are a fucking ton of them around…and would love nothing more than a set of demon horns for the wall, or a lycan skin rug. They’re here though, watching, doing their thing…I’d be careful what alley or sewer I decide to explore if I were you.


How do I know all this? Heh, well…just stay around for a while, you’ll see soon enough.  I should get going though, I have to meet my fiancée at the bar…
