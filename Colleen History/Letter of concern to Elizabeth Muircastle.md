Dearest Elizabeth,


I trust that this missive will find you well after your return to the island, and will continue to pray for your health.  I know how difficult travel is, especially going back to the deep south, but I certainly understand the necessity for Gaston to maintain his business interests.


Elizabeth, I hope you will not take this in a bad way, but I feel compelled to tell you that Father and I were both most concerned about Gaston’s behavior during your visit. The children are little darlings, especially young Xavier, but Gaston seemed, if I may use the word, almost possessed.  I’m quite afraid that the experience of losing his mother, and the pressures of keeping his company off the ground through the depression, may have driven him too far.


It is not my place to say it, but I was so frightened by his manner during your visit that I feel I must.  I am terribly afraid he may be a danger to you and the children.  Please… I am begging you dear sister, collect the children, and take the next train back to New York.  Lawrence and I will be more than happy to take all of you in for as long as you need. Perhaps the shock will be enough to bring Gaston to his senses, and if not, at least you and the children will be safe.


Alas, I’ve set to paper the words I was afraid to say in person. Please forgive me, and consider my request.


Your dearest loving sister,


Margaret
