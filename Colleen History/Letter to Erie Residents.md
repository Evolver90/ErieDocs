Dear Erie Residents:


This is a quick letter to update you on some of the amazing progress we've been making lately and to thank you for your continued involvement here in the sim.


Erie Isle opened in July of last year, and despite some challenges, we've seen a tremendous amount of growth.  Since the new year we've seen a lot of excitement in the sim as the different factions attempted to hold on to the Orb of Power; the Muircastle Twins attempted a return and takeover of the island, and ended up bringing on the return of a corporeal ghost of Gaston Muircastle, who subsequently destroyed both the hospital and courthouse.  


The groups are growing, and we're seeing a lot of activity on the island with player initiated roleplays, such as the establishment of the fire department, some creepy awful thing involving people hanging from the ceiling of the black market bleeding, and lots lots more. We have an active player-run town council, and plenty of nasty politics, backbighting, betrayal and other forms of entertainment!


The result has been a solid core of roleplayers having a tremendous amount of fun here: evidenced by the astonishing results of the Brigade hosted Date Auction: our players raised more than $140,000 lindens ($500 US dollars), which means our future as a sim is solidly paid through April 2009.  


So what's coming?  Here's a quick outline of what we see happening in the next few months:


1) We'd like to see significant expansion in the "off" hours... we have several hundred people in our main group from Europe... in the coming months we want to do more roleplays which focus on those hours, and we really want to invite _you_ to help initiate and make those happen.


2) In the next two weeks we plan to conduct a simwide out-of-character meeting/discussion to solicit your feedback about how things are going and what you'd like to see improved.


3) Continued expansion of the factions in the sim, with additional staff recruited for roleplay hours friendly to players in Europe, Austrailia/New Zealand and elsewhere. 


4) The opening of a second, "residential" sim, which will include a small number of plots available for sale to those who would like to own land in the Erie "universe".  Details are in the attachment. If you're interested in getting involved in this, please contact me directly. 􀀃


Please _always_ feel free to contact the Erie GM staff with suggestions, questions and concerns, and remember to have fun!  


Thank you all for making Erie such a great place to play!


Colleen
