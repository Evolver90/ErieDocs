Dear Father Lantos,


Thank you for writing to ArchBishop McCallister regarding the artifact which was captured by your civil war privateer and brought back to the island.  I'm afraid to report back that indeed, the artifact is known to the Archbishop, and significant records of its history exist in the vatican archives.  Some of these mentions in the historical record go back well over a thousand years.  The danger this artifact represents cannot be understated.


We will be dispatching a team of specialists in this area immediately.  In the meantime, please ensure you keep the artifact secure, and especially out of the hands of those who might have even the slightest sins on thier conscience.  What I am allowed to tell you is that the Orb magnifies the weaknesses and especially petty anger of those who hold it, and can be a great danger not only to the holder, but anyone around them. 


Frankly, I would advise you to destroy the artifact the entirely. Unfortunately, the tools required are not at hand.  Our best research indicates that in order to destroy the artifact, you must have a number of specific items.
 
These items must be combined in a ritual manner described in the Witches Girmoir, a heretical text which is kept for historical research purposes at the Vatican. Undertaking such a ritual is beyond your expertise, therefore we ask you to hold and take no action other than protecting the artifact and ensuring it does not fall into the wrong hands.


In His name,


Monsignor Thomas
