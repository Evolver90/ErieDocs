My name is MaryAnne Seetan.  I'm a professor of paranormal studies at UCLA, and I'm keeping the diary as a record of my activities on Erie Island researching the rumored ghosts which have been reported on the island.


The first known sighting of a ghost here was reported many years ago, following the murder-suicide which was carried out by pharmaceutical magnate Gaston Muircastle.  Mr. Muircastle was head of a multi-billion dollar company, distributing critical aids medications, among other things, across the globe.  No one knows the precise reason he did what he did, but one late night fifteen years ago, Mr. Muircastle murdered his three children, dismembered them, then proceeded to do the same to his wife.  That done, he scattered the parts in some sort of pattern all over the house and its grounds, when into the library of the house, and shot himself with a .45 caliber pistol.  Oddly enough, when the police and investigative units arrived, the weapon was never found.


Over the years it has repeatedly been reported that the island is haunted. Strange appearances of spectres occur, usually centered around the house, though the ghost of Mr. Muircaste has been known to appear all over the island.

I've now set up monitors and camera systems on the island, focusing on the house primarily.  I've had no sitings yet, but continue to monitor

My first sighting. This photo was taken in the park near the old Muircastle estate.

Today I spoke with the commander of the brigade, a group of ... well, vigilantes is the best I can think of.  They were largely unhelpful.

I had the strangest experience near the cemetary.  I went to check on my monitors there, and discovered all the wiring had been cut and the batteries removed!  These were on all the monitors near the crypt, and it clearly was not carried out by supernatural agency... unless ghosts carry wire cutters around with them.  Just as I finished, I spotted someone watching me from behind the corner of the crypt.  But when I ran after whoever it was, they were gone.

Another sighting today, this time near the gypsy camp.  Two old men were there... undoubtedly some fo the original residents of the island.... and when the ghost appeared one of them had a heart attack and died. I couldn't seem to find any authorities to take care of the body, but the nice woman who runs the medical clinic said she would take care of it.


I can't help but wonder why all of the sightings seem to center around the park near the gypsy camp... I've recorded absolutely nothing at all in the house at the top of the hill.  Perhaps there's something in the park that the spectres are attracted to.


July 4th. 


Wish I was home watching the fireworks instead of staying here.  Had horrible nightmares last night... the two little Muircastle girls floating outside my window, singing the ABCs and giggling. Both of them were covered with blood.


The things was... this morning I found ... I don't know... footprints?  Just a couple... might be my imagination... but it looked all the world like the muddy footprints of a little girl... right next to my bed.

I may have stumbled on something important.  I was having dinner at Club Restricted when an old woman stumbled in and sat down next to me.  She told me a story that's been floating around the island for more than twenty years apparently.  The story goes that during a major stock market downturn, Mr. Muircastle transferred more than 5 million dollars into gold bullion and buried it somewhere in the park!  I don't know if its true or not, but it might explain the constant sightings there.

Okay.... strange. I did some digging, literally, in the park, and found nothing.  However...  underneath the swing set I found a spot which had recently been dug up.  The earth there is packed hard.... someone worked really hard to get underneath.  Inside, I found an old wooden box with a lock which had been smashed.  The box was just big enough to fit a large book.  What the hell? 


Tomorrow night I've set up a meeting with someone from the Unseen... at least they claim to be.  We're to meet in the alley near Club Restrictred, so hopefully I can get some more information.

Today I spoke with the commander of the brigade, a group of ... well.. to put it delicately... militant lunatics.  The brigade commander was singularly unhelpful... told me not only were there no ghosts on the island, but that it would be in my best interest to butt out and leave before something happened to me.

Another sighting today, this time near the homeless shelter/former elementary school... again, right near the park.

I couldn't seem to find any authorities to take care of the body, but the nice woman who runs the homeless shelter said she would take care of it.
