This note is to.. whoever should come across this chest. My name is MaryAnne Seetan, I'm a paranormal researcher and professor at UCLA.  I've been on the island for several weeks now investigating some of the bizarre reports, and came upon this spot while investigating the locked room in the hospital.  


I've tried everything I can to get in there... including taking bolt cutters to the chains, and a sledgehammer to the wall, but the place is ... remarkably strong.  


In any event, the notes left by Dr. Steiner is late 1938 indicated that he buried the key to the locks somewhere near the lighthouse.  After several days searching and digging around, I found this chest near the edge of the water.


Unfortunately, it appears I wasn't the first person to search here... the box was broken open many years ago.  The only clue I found was a checkout card from the library... the book is the 1899 edition of Egyptian Magic by Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, who was an Egyptologist of some note.  Apparently the book was checked out of the library on November 13, 1944, I'll be searching the library next to see if I can locate it and figure out what the connection may be.  


In any event, whoever checked out that book in November '44 is undoubtedly the person who located Dr. Steiner's key.  


I'm leaving this note behind because I feel it would be irresponsible to remove the chest from its current location without a proper archeaological team. It's been here for more than eighty years, through hurricanes, disasters, fires... I think it will keep for a few more weeks.  I'll be getting in touch with the university to see if we can get one out here at a later date... in the the meantime I'm sealing the chest as best I can.


With regards,
