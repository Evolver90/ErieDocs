Dear Father Eckridge,


As you know, father, I've always welcomed your patronage at the library, and I'd like to say that over the years we have become personal friends.  That's why I'm truly disappointed to be writing this letter.


As you know, I allowed you to check out E.A. Budge's Egyptian Magic from the special collection, even though it was a first edition and nearly fifty years old.  That was on the promise that it would be returned in two weeks.


I'm certain you haven't lose complete track of the time.  The book was due to be returned on November 27, 1944.  That was over two months ago, sir.  I'm writing this letter to inform you that fines will be levied against your account, and that your library priviledges have been revoked until the book has been returned.


I hope you will soon return the book, and that we can resume our former friendship.


With highest regards,


Mrs. Matusiak
Erie Library and Museum
