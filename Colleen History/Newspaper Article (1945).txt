PARISH PRIEST COMMITS SUICIDE IN FRONT OF CONGREGATION


In a shocking turn of events, Father Ross Eckridge, late of Erie Isle Cathedral, commited suicide in front of his congregation yesterday morning.


Father Eckridge was well loved in the community, and according to all accounts, no one had any idea that anything was wrong with him.  Persistent rumors in the town continue that the island itself is haunted, and father Eckridge had spent the last year of his life investigating those rumors.  


Details of the priests burial are currently unconfirmed, and speculation abides that the Bishop will not allow him to be buried in the cemetary grounds given the nature of his death.
