Original Title: The Orb and the Curse... how the next few days will play out


Okay.. so here's the rough plan. This is adjustable as we need to, this plan was roughly agreed to after some negotiation, and we can always negotiate more.  


That said, we have two main issues right now:


1) First, Gaston still has the orb.


2) Second, the Dreadshift have gone and cursed the doors all over town.


Effectively, the plan is this.  


1) First, as a _temporary_ mitigating effect, Journey is collecting a group of angels to try to minimize the effect of the curse.  The goal here is basically to _reduce_ the damage to tolerable levels and make it not such a pain in the ass to come and go in the sim.


2) Second... the Orb will be taken from Gaston using the ritual of cleansing outlined already. However, it will _not_ destroy the orb.  The orb has to be carried back to hell where it came from in order to do that.


3) On this coming Saturday... during a timeframe we can get both north america and euro players on.... we'll have a quest.  A group of explorers will use the orb to take themselves... and the orb... into hell where they will attempt to destroy the orb and remove the curse


4) At the same time, the dreadshift will send its folks to go after the explorers


5) This will be a bit of a race. There will be two skyboxes.... one for hell... one for heaven.  Demons and vampires go to the heaven one, others go to the hell one.   They have to a) survive their respective trials, b) race across a ribbon of light between the two realms to reach the center, where there is a sword driven through a block of stone.  Touching the sword releases the curse (and a lot of nasty monsters).


So what we get out of this is: the curse lifted, some fun stuff getting there, and the orb finally destroyed, Gaston put away.
