Notes written on a dusty sheet of paper, folded in the back of a book of really bad poetry.  The notes are written in a fine hand, as if with a calligraphy pen, and the paper itself is crumbling and worn.






===== THE ORB OF POWER =====


The Orb was first found and brought to the Island in the summer of '63.  Newspaper accounts at the time indicated it was captured from a Yankee cargo ship by a privateer commanded by William Franklin Muircastle III.  When Muircastle's ship sank in the harbor of Erie Island, Muircastle made it ashore... the only surviving member of the ships crew.


Muircastle himself died 3 days after his ship sank, apparently the victim of insanity. He did relate, however, that the Orb appeared to be an artifact of considerable power, and had long been associated with demonic phenomena.   It may well be that investigators should be requested from the Vatican.  In the meantime, I shall take it upon myself to lock the thing up in the Cathedral where prying hands can't touch it. I've written to the archbishop asking for further information from the Vatican archives, in hopes of finding a way to destroy the infernal device.
