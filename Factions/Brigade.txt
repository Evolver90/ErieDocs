As the town falls into dysfunction and chaos we are the ones to return order. We are the ones who are the light in the darkness. We lift those who have fallen. We fight for those who can't fight for themselves. We heal and treat the injured and the sick. We battle the plague eating this town. We are the Brigade.


As Erie descended into its darkness, a ragged core of people, formed around the remains of the city's emergency services, dedicated themselves to protecting those citizens who were left behind.  Former police,  EMS crews, doctors, soldiers, and ordinary citizens all rallied to the cause.  


Using intelligence, tact, and at times overwhelming force we are here to help those who remain in town, providing  our own form of justice, security, and mercy when none other is to be found. 


If you are willing to help your fellow citizens, and place yourself between citizens of Erie and the still gathering Darkness, you ill have a place in the Brigade. Race and history is not as important as a desire and will to help your fellow citizens.


Join the Brigade today, we are in it for Erie!
