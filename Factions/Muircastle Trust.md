The Muircastle Trust


In 1910 Eleanor Muircastle founded the Muircastle Trust to be a charitable organization to help the less fortunate of Erie Isle.  Shortly After the tragic death of its founder the Trust was taken over by Fredrick Muircastle. The members of the Trust soon went a little strange and became obsessed with what they call the *Great Work*. The Trustees became even stranger under the guidance of Gaston Muircastle after the death of his father and odd rumours began to circulate around the Isle about the true goals of the Trust and of a secret contract.
