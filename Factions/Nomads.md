The Nomads


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Nomad caravan was stranded on Erie Isle by the horrible seiries of circumstances that have plagued the town. These gypsies survive by endeavoring to allieviate the misery through their humble talents as entertainers, fortune tellers, musicians, dancers, acrobats, artists, and, well, other pursuits that require finesse and quick hands. Their hopes are that by providing these mild diversions they can in some small way contribute to the larger host community, and keep the law out of their campsite.


It would be foolish to judge this ragtag band at first glance. The long roads they have traveled have allowed them to aquire many skills and trades. True, their colorful clothes are somewhat threadbare, but their dancers can move the coldest of hearts. They are cunning negotiators, shrewd barterers, and opportunistic adventurers. Their weapons may look dated, but never underestimate their skill in using them. And, its best to keep your eyes on your belongings, as they have preternaturally swift hands. 


Despite the mistrust which they are sometimes met with, their events are widely attended and enjoyed by the non-gypsy townfolk. They have hosted carnivals, fairs, simple outdoor dances, and chilling campfire ghost story nights. They have a certain flair for the dramatic, and a knack for separating people from their money, all with sparkling eyes and a knowing smile.


Their campsite is known as a resting place, even a refuge, as they are welcoming of strangers and pleasant hosts. It is rumored that they provide shelter for even some creatures of the night. However, they will defend themselves fiercely if threatened, and it serves one well to remember their manners when on that side of the island. They have their own customs and speak their own language which few others understand, allowing them to be secretive even in front of guests.


A sign outside their park is painted by the hand of a gifted signpainter on a rough old piece of paneling. It reads:  Sastimos, Friend. Welcome to our camp. We are always looking for entertainers of natural talent and skill, or those willing to learn a trade. Search for Pigman Quandry, Scripta Scribe, or Hawk Perway. Latcho Drom, Good journey to you.”

Nomad Ranks


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. Beginning rank
Nomad Grifter
The starting rank for all Nomads. Grifters are survivors, making due with what skill, wit, creativity, or charm that they possess. These traits allow them to survive another day, benefit the caravan as a whole, and when perfected lead to their advancement in rank. 




2. Secondary ranks
Nomad Gilabno/i (Perform)
Entertainers are the lifeblood of the Nomads. This is how we make our living  as well as stay in good relations with the town as a whole. These members are at the very heart of all of our activities. Gilabno(male, Gilabni = female) means singer, or reader, but also implies wider public and performing arts. These are entertainers, storytellers, performer, etc.... These members are responsible for thinking up acts and events and helping to promote and run them. As they are likely to interact frequently with gadje (non-gypsies), we also rely on them to be the 'kan', or ear, for the Nomads as a whole.


Nomad Drabarni/o (Heal)
Drabani means herbalist, but also fortune teller. These are our camp healers. They may or may not have mystical or magic origins. Fortune Telling is an art, as psychological as magical, and can be played either way, or as a mix. Its primary magic, however, is to seperate gadje from their money. Healers do not have to be fortune tellers, and non-healers may also practice this art.


Nomad Dand (Guard)
Dand means 'tooth,' these are our guardians, both of the campsite, and of the members at large.  Loyalty and weapons skill are paramount for these members


Nomad Veshengo/i
Veshengo means 'person of the forest,' or wildman, and is the title of Nomad sideshow attractions, persons whose physical anomolielies alone qualify them as performers. They may be freaks, spectacles, clowns, jesters, bafoons, or abominations, much as traditional carnies, but they are full and fully equal members of the camp. It is under this guise that the Nomads can 'hide' some of the more unusual residents of the Isle, although this does not necessarily protect them from hostility outside the Nomad camp.




3. Tertiary ranks
Nomad Bulibasha
These are traditional local leaders and resolvers of disputes. They are important trainers and leaders and providers of stability in the group. They are expected to know our customs and traditions and to be able to pass them on to newer Nomads.


Nomad Strong Arm
Head defenders of the camp and it members. Also responsible for training members in the basics of self defence. 




4. Highest rank
Nomad Baro Shero
Literally 'Big Head', what gadje sometimes call gypsy kings or queens. They settle disputes and strive for harmony across multiply bands of gypsies and are valued for their wisdom, experience, and loyalty. Current camp leaders include: Scripta Scribe, Pigman Quandry, and Hawk Perway
