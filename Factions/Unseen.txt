There is a myth about a faction named the Unseen


It is unknown when this faction was founded or who even founded it. The members remain unknown as well. The Unseen like their privacy. Many believe that they are made up of a bunch of Rogue. When the city became cursed and abanoned they went underground.


People say that the rumored Unseen know all that goes on within the city. Including all ancient history of the city. No one knows exactly who is in the group or where they meet.  It's believed that they perform rituals and it's even been said that they perform sacrifices.

The Unseen of Erie Isle


The Unseen is a legendary secret society rumored to congregate in the Highview town cemetary on Erie Isle.  A hidden guild of assassins, rogues, thieves and ex-priests, it's safest if you don't know of their existence.


"A life of pain, is a life of happiness. A life of misery, is a life of hatred."


The history of this guild begins with the history of a book. This book belonged to a clan, an order, a family. One of the members of this family descided to know the secrets that this book contained. So he did what he was trained to do and stole it, while removing the lives of his family in the process. There were only two survivors: a young boy, and a young lady. They were given a chance to start their lives anew. 


Many years have passed since that event took place. Having to set their family in the ground, their lives were full of pain. This event lead to to construction to a guild of Assassins, Rogues, Thieves, and ex-priests known as The Unseen.  If you find yourself alone and wandering, do not dwell in dispair. For you have come to a place where we have come to know no fear. What we do in life will echo through the ages. Taking in the beaten and battered this guild holds family to a higher level. Our loyalty to each other knows no boundry. Do not fear the pain, embrace it to your hands and weild it as if it were your arm. 


A life told is to be known, but to die is to be unseen. Live to be unseen.


We who are alone seek the solice of the cemetery, to wait for our death.


Membership in the Unseen is by invitation of the group leaders.
