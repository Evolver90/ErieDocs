The Verschrik


There is no reason, there is no void, there is only one’s nature. There are no sides, there is no equal, there is only the fear of the dominant. This is not perfect darkness, this is not righteous redemption, it is only true and pure chaos. - Creed of the Verschrik


The Verschrik do not consider themselves as evil as true as it may be; they follow the simple reasons for their own existence in the haunted island of Erie and consider themselves as the dominant creatures which reside there. The coven was first founded by the ancient demon Delrith who feasted on the flesh and souls of the residents of the island under the guise of a wandering priest. But as he exposed himself to what he truly was he gathered all those who sought to further his cause and create a kingdom of dire creatures and monsters whose sole purpose is to drive fear and chaos into all those who remain in Eire Isle. He and his followers call themselves the Verschrik.


= Verschrik Rules =


All creatures, beings, and monsters a welcomed in the Verschrik Brood; however acceptance into the family is not always an easy task. Certain requirements must be met if you are to survive within. If you contain all these traits listed by nature approval within the Verschrik is almost certain.


The first requirement for the Verschrik is very simple. The need to satisfy what hungers us. It is only natural to settle what ails living things…and that includes all our urges by any means necessary. However this satisfaction can be interrupted if it ultimately ends up bring harm to another of our kindred. As a brood we are all obligated to respect one another where we will never leave each other in a state of lone affairs, we all work as one and protect as one.


What also remains imperative to all of us regarding reverence is the establishment of our hierarchy. Recognized to be similar to a monarchy; it is critical that all remain aware who remains superior to you as the line between each rank is divided. Respect those higher and they will return it.


Though organized we are the Verschrik’s main ideal and lifestyle is driven by the pureness of chaos and discord. It is the way of monsters such as ourselves to survive only on the assurance that in no way is there to be order and peace whilst we exist. The only true array is the Verschrik and nothing else.


The final rule to the Verschrik remains simple and above every other: Fear. Our coven shall and will always remain supreme as long as fear is distilled into the hearts of all those who are enemy and friend. All must know their place in this island, and we know ours. So remind everyone what theirs is…


= Verschrik Hierarchy =


As stated before the Hierarch of the Verschrik is similar to that of a monarchy which is categorized in three divisions: The Royals, the Arches, and the Disciples. The Disciples symbolize themselves as the loyal followers of the brood and its foot soldiers. The Arches contain those who uphold what is set down by the royals in order to maintain the chaos in which drives the Verschrik. The Royals reign supreme over both the Arches and Disciples, not only do they act as the overlords to all but they assure the rest of the coven that only the Verschrik is the true path within the chaos. 


~ Royal Verschrik ~


- Terror King - The Supreme hierarch of the Verschrik brood and its leader into the true path of chaos. The King rules alone unless he appoints a Queen or Verwalter to rule beside him. There can only be one Terror King.


- Terror Queen – The Supreme hierarch of the Verschrik if the king is not present or appointed. The Queen also rules alone unless she too appoints a King or Verwalter beside her. There can only be one Terror Queen


- Verwalter – The Verwalters act as the stewards to the King or Queen and often act as their voice, hand, and eyes. When either the King or Queen is incapable of governing the brood the Verwalters are to take their places during the duration of their absence. There can be up to 2-3 Verwalters elected into position.


~ Arch Verschrik ~


- Arbiter – The pinnacle of the Arch Verschrik are the Arbiters. The Arbiters act both as judges of the Verschrik and it’s converters. Their primary jobs include carrying out the punishments which traitors or any crime members within the group commit, and those who spread and summon those into the cause and glory of the Verschrik. There can be up to 4-5 Arbiters if the Disciples are proven worthy to take up this profession.


- Terror Knight – Though the bottom of the Arch Verschrik hierarchy the Terror Knights remain to be of an equal rank as the Arbiters and respected just the same. However the Knights govern totally over each rank of Verschrik Disciples. The Knights are more commonly looked at as elites of combatant forces within the Verschrik when battle is necessary. There can be up to 4-5 Terror Knights if the Disciples are proven worthy to take up this profession.


~ Verschrik Disciples ~


- Armsmen – The true soldiers of the Verschrik and hunters of the brood. The title of Armsmen only remain to be a ranking term rather than a formal one since they remain with a choice in which the want to excel to. The Armsmen also act as squires to the Arbiters and Terror Knights when they remain in need of one. There is no limit to how many Armsmen there can be, though they remain a result of what Pawns are when they have proven themselves.


- Pawn – The base rank of the entire Verschrik brood. All members that first join the Verschrik start out as a Pawn who symbolizes the loyalty and dedication to the brood. Though the lowest rank they may be they are what make the brood beat as one and follow under the leadership of their higher ups without question in hopes of being greatly rewarded for their devotion.
