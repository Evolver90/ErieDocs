Erie 


Erie Isle is a barely populated island off the coast of Wilmington, North Carolina.


In the 1800s it was mostly inhabited by fishermen. Most of the residents of the island were superstitious but believed in a Christian God. There was a darker side to the island, though. Some of the residents were not who they appeared to be and in fact belonged to a secretive cult known as the Twilight. This group of individuals were, in fact, in complete control of the island. They worshipped a dark god, whose name was known only to them. The Twilight met in the shadows, wearing masks and hoods to protect their identities. Only the very highest ranking members knew who they are meeting with. Through dark secrets and midnight rituals, the Twilight ruled Erie Island.


There is an urban legend in Erie. A legend of a sea monster, who drags men to their deaths. The earliest mention of such a creature seems to be in an account of a visiting ship in 1863. The ship had come into port, stocked up on supplies and set sail. The next day, Captain Muircastle washed ashore… drenched, half dead, raving of demons and blood.
It's said that the island's residents could see them, following the man around, almost keeping out of sight but stalking him everywhere until his dying day, three days later. Nobody mourned for the captain. Everyone was glad he was gone. His followers had made these God-fearing folk very uneasy and they were so convinced that this was an act of their Christian Devil that the man's claim of a sea monster, rather than being taken seriously, were turned into a humorous tale which passed through history as a story to frighten children. This creature came to be known affectionately as "Steve'.


Only the Twilight know its true name and only the Twilight know the truth of the story behind the captain's death. Outsiders arriving on Erie meant only bad things to their organisation. The captain and his crew were a threat to the Twilight. They couldn't be allowed to leave, perhaps to bring others to the island and upset the Twilight's long held rule. The cult met the night before the ship was to set sail and through the foulest rituals and unholy whisperings called upon their creature for assistance. Life on the island continued as usual and soon everyone forgot the captains visit.

The next Muircastle visit to the island came more than 40 years later in 1907.
The man was a wealthy businessman and owner of a rising pharmaceutical company. He came to Erie with his wife, Eleanor, and built his estate there.
Frederik's arrival forever changed the island. He brought jobs with him and a chance to do something other than fish, which many of the fishing families were known for having little luck with (in no small part due to the Twilight's secret control of the sea.)


The Muircastle Corporation shipping lines were beneficial to the Twilight, who ensured safe passage for these vessels so they could utilise them for their own trade means, smuggling illegal items onto the island and for a time, it appeared that perhaps they could co-exist.


Very quickly, though, the Twilight found their power waning and realised that the introduction of an industry they had no hand in could mark the end of their power. Their influence on the island was built upon the fishing trade and it was this influence which fed the more sinister needs of their religious meetings. More than one man "lost his life at sea" to appease their dark benefactors. They allowed the traffic to the island to increase, though, despite their traditional opposition to this. The ambitious leaders of the Twilight saw that they could not stop this entirely and so instead plotted new means of controlling a larger population.


Life on Erie changed radically in the next few years and the island soon bustled and thrived, thanks in no small part to Eleanor. Growing slightly bored with being locked away within their new mansion, she soon decided it would be a good idea to hold regular events, festivals to entertain the townsfolk.
Erie Isle soon became known as a tourist attraction, the events and festivals attracting visitors from all around, the town expanding, people from all walks of life arriving on the island, each and every year the events getting bigger and better.


In 1910, Eleanor Muircastle founded the Muircastle Trust to be a charitable organization to help the less fortunate of Erie Isle.


The Twilight leaders were still active. As life on the island changes they they spread the idea that perhaps a sheriff should be elected. They put their own man into the position and used him to further their control over goings on on the island.


Eleanor was not unaware of the Twilight's activites, though she couldn't possibly imagine their size and strength. She went to the Sheriff with the information she had found and he told her to keep it quiet, reassuring her he would take care of the situation. He relayed this information back to his masters.

1914.
The beaten, bruised and blooded body of Eleanor Muircastle is found naked in the bedroom of Muircastle Manor, discovered by the grief-stricken Frederik.


Frederik is made aware by agents of the Twilight that means exist to bring Eleanor back to him.
He is manipulated into buying from them all manner of arcane texts, which they transport to the island on Muircastle's own ships.
Frederik begins to unknowingly associate with the Twilight, all reason lost to him in his search for a way to be reunited with his wife.


Gaston P. Muircastle was just eight years of age when his mother died, and he was there with his father, an unknowing participant of what would come next. His father stood before him, and others walked around him, robed and cowled. Dark words filled the air, it suddenly becoming thick, darkness swirling around him. Gaston had no way of fathoming what was going on, and could only watch in silent horror as he saw what his father had done. The body of his dead mother twisting and deforming, changing into a creature of nightmares.


Gaston watched as his father and the cowled others struggled with the infernal beast, he watched as the creature slaughtered them all.. but worst of all, he watched as it turned to him, and smiled, before returning to the darkness, leaving him standing within the room surrounded by violence and gore.


The creature summoned by this ritual is that worshipped by the Twilight. Gaston remains marked by it, tainted.
He leaves the island, returning ten years later to assume control of the company. All of this time he struggled with the creature that inhabited him.

1938
Gaston felt pulled, called almost to the basement. He removed the seals and went inside, the visions flooding into his mind, pushing him over the edge. The taint seeped into him, bidding him do the grim work that came next. He visited his wife as she slept, strangling her, her eyes flickering open to see him before he took her life.


He repeated his work five times that night, each one of his children dying to their fathers own hands, his mind ravaged beyond his control. A moment of clarity came afterwards, and Gaston, in his anguish, took his own life.


It was the moment his blood touched the cold ground that the ritual completed itself. The ritual his father had began so many years before, the ritual that had taken his fathers life and the lives of so many, the ritual that had torn Gaston’s mind. The land of Erie cracked, and tore, a dense mist spilling over the landscape as the darkness spread out, warping the land.


Weather changed, the land beaten and ravaged by the hostility of a sudden change in its nature. Tornados tore into the buildings, floods washed away the lives of many inhabitants, lightning ripped dense woodlands apart. Erie was changed.


The few inhabitants left tried to band together, forsaking the buildings, their possessions, their dead.. everything. They tried to hide.. but some had changed. The people noticed a change in the air, some of them feeling strange, unusual.. suddenly finding themselves doing things none could before.. and it frightened them. Wolves, Dogs, Cats, even Bats and Rats changed, their nature changing, becoming more feral, as if the lands had empowered them, given them a lust for something more...


Where once life reigned, now the dead walked, shades of life haunting the old lands. There were reports of strange sightings.. darkness reigned...


Erie Isle was changed, the air was thick with something beyond that of normal understanding, something beyond that, something.. alive, and malevolent.

((NOTE: THE CREATURE/SPIRIT/CURSE BROUGHT TO EARTH BY THE RITUAL AND ACTIVELY WORSHIPPED BY THE TWILIGHT WHICH IS ALSO COVERTLY THE FOUNDER OF THE DREADSHIFT AND IS PRETTY MUCH OUR BIGGEST BAD GUY AND THE FINAL BOSS OF THE INTERNET SHALL HEREAFTER BE KNOWN ONLY AS "THE ENTITY"))
THE ENTITY splits into three aspects. Three seperate forms, intending to use each to further its aim of spreading beyond the island and destroying the barrier between the world of the living and the world of the dead. The first inhabits the body of the sheriff who took Eleanor Muircastle's life. The second inhabits the body of a cannibalistic priest. The third aspect builds a form out of the misery of the island's residents drawing from the depression and growing in strength once they learn of Eleanor's death. This form is intangible and can appear in any guise it pleases. Later, it can totally come back looking like Eleanor and be a creepy bitch.


The second aspect of the Curse takes up residence in the lighthouse, starting to gather an army of unholy creatures, bringing them in with talk of its plan to unleash hell on earth, with its loyal servants ruling as gods. From this, The Dreadshift are born and given a reason to exist. Unbeknownst to them, they are being lead by the same creature who is behind the Twilight's power.


Gaston returns to the island as a ghost, still half mad from the taint of the creature which took his family from him. Using his mother's Muircastle Trust as a vehicle, he seeks to bring his mother back to life. The Curse is anchored to his mother, so doing so would rid the island of this curse as well. The Trust reflects Gaston's dual nature, neither entirely good nor entirely bad. Gaston is the spirit behind the house. The suicides and madnesses of the islands residents following his death are often from encounters with him and the effects of the taint present in his spirit rather than direct contact with THE ENTITY itself.




Summary of the effects of the proposed changes.


Gaston Muircastle: Usually aligned with the Trust. His goal is to free his dead mother from the curse. 


Eleanor Muircastle: Gained the unfavourable attention of the Twilight by quickling rising to lead the social scene on the island. When Eleanor uncovered elements of the Twilight's existence, she took it to the Sheriff, who was a Twilight plant and ended her life on his masters' orders.


Frederik Muircastle: Gained the unfavourable attention of the Twilight when he came to the island and upset the status quo. After the Twilight assassinated his wife, they manipulated him in his grief to participate in one of their dark rituals to bring her back. 




The Twilight have sole control over which ships are allowed into the area.
The Muircastle Corporation is the only group who can get ships in and the Twilight uses these vessels to smuggle illegal items in for the black market.


Twilight: Aligned with THE ENTITY who has led them since their founding.
1) Introducing a pre-Muircastle Twilight history
2) Describing a previously vague arcane element of the group.
3) Explaining the Twilight's rise to power.
5) Adding a future element of conflict with the Dreadshift (They secretly worship the same entity)
6) Introducing some historical conflict with the Muircastle Trust over which society controlled the town.


Dreadshift:  Aligned with THE ENTITY who has led them since their founding.
1) Introducing a previously lacking founding story.
2) Giving the faction a desperately needed raison d'être besides "we are mean demons."
3) Tying the Dreadshift into the Muircastle lore as well as giving them a direct link to the Twilight


Muircastle Trust:  Aligned with Gaston who shares their aim of cleansing the island of the curse by bringing Eleanor back from the dead.
1)Explanation for the changes made by Sadie and Lia which were detrimental to sim mythos.
(Examples: Lia's claims that her character was in a relationship with Gaston. Sadie's playing on Lia's claim that the "Great Work" of the Trust is whatever the head of Trust wants it to be, deviating from Muircastle related aims.)
The ghosts allowed Sadie and Lia to plot as if they were unaware, while manipulating the situation so that Seras would come into control of the house, as she shares Gaston's aims.
2)Introducing some historical conflict with the Twilight over which society controlled the town.
3) Defining Gaston's relationship to the house, the curse and his mother.
