Erie Isle is a barely populated island off the coast of Wilmington, North Carolina. However, despite it's small size and lack of population, it has a history that is as bloody as many battlefields.


 The Island itself was first colonized by the colony of North Carolina in 1779, in the midst of the Revolutionary War. The island was the site of Fort Erie, which served more as a prison camp then any military function. It was here that one of the first signs of a deep seated darkness appeared on the island.  In the building in the center of the fort, which would later become Bayview Sanatorium, all of the Native American population of the island were imprisoned while the Colonial Government started work on colonization of the island for their own use. The prisoners were grossly mistreated, most of them either died of smallpox or the Trauma they endured there. Those that survived were shipped off to reservations once the fort shut down. 


In the 1800s it was mostly inhabited by fishermen. Most of the residents of the island were superstitious but believed in a Christian God. There was a darker side to the island, but no one could put their finger on it, women dissapearing in the night, sometimes children. A bone chilling scream rings out from the chapel occasionally, but most are to fearful to investigate.


There is an urban legend in Erie. A legend of a sea monster, who drags men to their deaths. The earliest mention of such a creature seems to be in an account of a visiting ship in 1863. The ship had come into port, stocked up on supplies and set sail. The next day, Captain Muircastle washed ashore… drenched, half dead, raving of demons and blood.
Three days later, the captian died. Nobody mourned for the captain. Everyone was glad he was gone. His followers had made these God-fearing folk very uneasy and they were so convinced that this was an act of the Devil or just a raving lunatic that the man's claim of a sea monster, rather than being taken seriously, were turned into a humorous tale which passed through history as a story to frighten children. This creature came to be known affectionately as "Steve'.


Life on the island continued as usual and soon everyone forgot the captains visit, but his claims of a sea monster became somewhat of a traditional icon of the island.

The next Muircastle visit to the island came more than 40 years later in 1907.


Fredrick Muircastle was a wealthy businessman and owner of a rising pharmaceutical company. He came to Erie with his wife, Eleanor, and built his estate there.
Frederik's arrival forever changed the island. He brought jobs with him and a chance to do something other than fish, which many of the fishing families were known for having little luck with 


The Muircastle Corporation shipping lines were beneficial to the town, that the city elite took quick notice of this upstart. They looked on him and his wife with suspision, but could not deny that he was helping the island with his ships and trade. 


Very quickly, though, the old city elite found their power waning and realised that the introduction of an industry they had no hand in could mark the end of their power. Their influence on the island was built upon the fishing trade and it was this influence which they felt was theirs alone to hold. 


But, reguardless of the murmerings of discontent from the Social Elite, life on Erie changed radically in the next few years and the island soon bustled and thrived, thanks in no small part to Eleanor. Growing slightly bored with being locked away within their new mansion, she soon decided it would be a good idea to hold regular events, festivals to entertain the townsfolk.


Erie Isle soon became known as a tourist attraction, the events and festivals attracting visitors from all around, the town expanding, people from all walks of life arriving on the island, each and every year the events getting bigger and better.


Even at this time, however, there were the occasional report of strange things happening around the Cathdrel every so often, reports of hooded figures in the dead of night and strange noises. The newly constructed graveyard also had it's share of ghost sightings, which was not helped by the mysterious vanishing of several sailors around the time.


Eleanor was not unaware of the discontent within the upper circles of society, and often tried her best to help assure them that both her and her husband were there to help, rather then hinder them.

1908-1912


Born out of the Muircastle's Festivals, the carnival moved into town during Erie's hayday in 1908. Even the setting up of the multi-coloured tents and exotic performers was a sight to behold, drawing most of the town to its fences for a sneak peek before the opening. Manager, Sparky Winslow was a lifetime carny, having grown up in them during the late 1880's.  The spectacle of the carnival was his forte. He lived and breathed the fixed games, the stalls and his famous side show. Among them were many famous performers in their own right, such as the Brothers Twain, a Siamese twin act who could swallow fire and swords or the enormous fat lady, Miss Bet. and later the Wily Widow.


In 1910, Eleanor Muircastle founded the Muircastle Trust to be a charitable organization to help the less fortunate of Erie Isle. This organization was a labor of love from Eleanor and her closest friends to the people of Erie. 


In 1911, the carnival got a breath of new life with a few new additions to its repartee. An acrobatic high line act was brought in to wow the citizens of Erie. A married couple, Barnard and Penelope were beautiful. They worked effortlessly together high above the crowds. Each step, each near fall to the screaming and panicked onlookers was a well planned art of two well trained professionals. 


Another addition to the carnival was renowned Gypsy and fortune teller in 1912. Between 1912 and 1914, she gave out harmless readings, read cards as if she could see the future and entertained giddy customers.

1914.


The beaten, bruised and blooded body of Eleanor Muircastle is found naked in the bedroom of Muircastle Manor, discovered by the grief-stricken Frederik. Though it was unknown to Fredrick, there was speculation all around. People claimed it was everyone from The Mayor, to a crazed homless bum. 


Fredrick, understandibly, was devistated. He slowly became more and more withdrawn from the community at large and started to become more and more sullen. There were whispers among his friends that he was starting to look into occult books at the library, though he denyed such things vilhelmently and urged the Sheriff's Department to continue their investigation into his wife's death no matter the cost. 


It was a couple of months later when the first major tradgedy stuck the Muircastle Family. No one knows what happened in the house that night, but one of the maids found twelve year old Gaston Muircastle sitting in the basement of the Manor in shock, just staring at the shredded remains of his father. He was quickly sent to the hospital, and then sent back to live with his extended family in France. 


With Fredrick's death came another change to the Trust. For the first time, they were without a leader. During this brief period of time, rather then just collapsing they continued working towards the orders given to them by their late Chairman until his son came of age.


After Fredrick and Eleanor's death, the carnival began to decline. Sparky brought in bare knuckle boxing matches  to please the crowds. They seemed to do the trick and he was able to make ends meet through taking advantage of the fighters.  Even if the carnival only consisted of a skeleton crew, Moire in her tent and a few freaks who had married into the population, they held on and got by the skin of their teeth. 


It was also during this time that the Sheriff of Erie, the one who had personally lead the investigation of the Murder of Eleanor Muircastle, Ingram Blackburn, committed suicide. Many of the townsfolk said that it was due to his failure to solve such a big case that he ended his own life out of shame.

1920.


With the dawn of a new decade, the Eighteen Year old Gaston muircastle returned to his home on Erie Island. His first act on returning was to take control of his father's business and the Muircastle Trust. He was a bit odd,and stand offish, but most blamed that on his troubled past. 


1927


In one of the most publicized cases of the 20's, the Erie Isle Sheriff's department entered the home of Father Lawrence  Kaufman after he had been reported missing for several days. The Priest was found dead in his home, his throat slit as well as his wrists. While searching the house for any clues as to the reason for his suicide, hey found a Refrigerator hidden behind a fake wall in one of the rooms, the only contents of which was half eaten human remains.  It was later found during the Coroner’s Investigation that the wounds on the priest's body were hardly self inflicted. However, no suspects were ever found, and he was succeeded by a man who he had considered a rival in life, Father Ross Eckridge.  


1928


Gaston brought the festivals back, and by extention the carnival was revived. Many of the performers were aged now, and had children who were ready to take over where their parents left off. The most talked about was a son who Sparky had actually claimed, the handsome and charming, John, who seemed to have inherited all his father's bad habits along with a drinking problem.

1930


With the Great Depression just starting to take hold over the United States, Gaston decided one day that he was going to make further advances in the feild of Medical Science. One day, he announced to the island the foundation of the Aeon Institute, an organization wholelly devoted to advancement in the many, and constantly growing, fields of science.  


However, for the carnival, things were hardly going well, it started with a fire starting one night, and killing at least several people. It was during the fire that Sparky killed Barnard by stabbing him with a kitchen knife. 


There was a lengthy trial, but Sparky was judged to have acted in a moment of insanity and spent a his sentence during the depression at Bayview Asylum. Once he was released, he came back to the mostly derelict carnival, repairing it and opening once more.

1938


It was in the early years of the trouble in Europe when the 31 year old Gaston Muircastle, out of fear for his family's safety checked himself into the Erie Asylum.  Gaston's stay was brief, less than a week, as on a night filled with strange storms, he was seen in a terrifed state running throught he streets of the town towards his home.


Then, the unthinkable happened. The entire Muircastle family was murdered. Most of the evidence points to Gaston having been the one who did it before taking his own life. No one is really sure why he did something like that, or how he could even bring himself to do it...but he did it. And after that, Erie was never the same.  First the Muircastle Corporation moved their headquarters off the island, and then local businesses started to get hit hard. Rumors of things like animal attacks increased and generally everything looked like it was starting to go downhill at a very quick rate. And then the weird reports started flooding in. People started reporting seeing ghosts everywhere, seeing the mythical Steve out in the bay, and seeing Gaston and his family wandering around near the manor after their death.


It was soon after the Muircastle Murder/Suicide that Sparky and his carnival used the tragedy to his advantage and brought back his carnival in full form, giving tours of haunted walks and building a fright house which detailed the history of the Muircastle's. The public clamoured for more and even during the war, attracted record crowds.. Reports of hauntings at the carnival were ever present and even the side show seemed different. Real freaks masquerading as deformed people began to arrive, phantoms and other creatures were seen tending to the machines and stalls. The public was none the wiser as they believed it all the making of Sparky.

1939-1943:


After Gaston's murder/sucide, many rumours started to form about the spirits of the dead starting to gather around Muircastle Manor, some claimed that there was some sort of magical pull drawing them there, but the Trust and Muircastle Corporation denied such claims. 


In 1943, a series of strange events, ranging from flickering lights and strange sounds to people mysteriously falling from the top of the stucture caused the increasingly decrepit Erie Lighthouse to be closed by the Mayor. Rumours of hauntings by the ghosts of angry sailors or the spruned lovers of sea captains started to spread throughout the town within days of the closure.

2008-Today:


Jon Coage, the son of one of Erie's Sheriffs returned to the island. He had been gone for many years, but a desire to solve a specific case had never left him. After abandoning his position in New York he made his way back to his birthplace, however upon seeing the state of his beloved hometown on his arrival he came to a decision. He would create an organization out of the bravest and strongest, the noble and the pure, and they would take Erie back from the horrors that had claimed it. At any cost.. 


Around the same time, there was much talk of a bunch of strange people having fights in the sewers and near the crypt. No one ever got a real good look at them, but it was mainly explained as some sort of Gang War. Even though many of the people seemed...strange. 


Standing in ruins and rust, the carnival of the town still exist today and though the tents seem empty and no one tends the old carousel, some say you can still hear the music and the laughter of the crowds inside its dilapidated confines. If you look closer still, you can spot some of the descendants of the carnival in the nomad camp, the underground fights and the strangely deformed creatures who dash just out of sight. It is in many ways similar to the city around it, though many of it's inhabitents cling to hope. Overall though, the town of Erie is a shadow of it's former glory. With gangs terrorizing the streets and weirdos hiding out in dark corners claiming they are demons.


We are now a decade into the new millenium, and Erie's future is uncertain. With spirits, demons, monsters, and all sorts of strange occurrences happening every day, things are only getting more complicated for the citizens of this once beautiful resort town
