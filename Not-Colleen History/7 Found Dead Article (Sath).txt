7 DEAD IN HORRIFIC MURDERS


The bodies of seven people were found today at the Muircastle estate in what a police spokesmen said was a horrific and terrible murder of the entire Muircastle family. 


The bodies were taken to Muircastle Memorial Hospital for forensic examination. Dr. Joseph Steiner, attending physician, conducted the exam and reported that they were “gruesomly mutilated” in the killing. Elizabeth gaston and her five children all died as a result of asphyxiation due to strangling.
 
Unconfirmed reports say the evidence at the crime scene found seem to indicate the prime suspect was none other than Gaston Muircastle himself, who appears to have shot himself after the brutal killings using what is believed to be a police issued handgun.


In an official statement this morning, the Chief of Police said "This is a terrible tragedy. We believe that Gaston Muircastle, who may have been suffering from work related stress, went on a rampage killing his loving wife and children before commiting suicide.  We are still investigating the area as for any clues to why Mr Muircastle would do such a horrendous thing but right now are hearts go out to family and friends.”


This is the second time mysterious murders have taken place at the estate: the first being many years ago when Eleanor Muircastle was found brutaly burdered at the house. Gaston Muircastle was her only surviving child.


The Muircastle family has long been a vanguard for this islands tourism, building and income.  Their loss will be a tragic blow and we give our regards to remaining family and friends.
