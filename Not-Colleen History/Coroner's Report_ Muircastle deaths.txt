Additional notes:
Since the Muircastle family was examined in this room, hospital staff refuse to enter.  Staff cite extreme fear when approaching, many whisper it is haunted. Obviously nonsense, however, we may be forced to close the room off if staff continue to avoid it.

Nurse Belham committed suicide last night after the she made an attempt to clean the room. She kept screaming that one of the children was still in the room.  I've made the decision to permanently seal it.  I've locked it securely, and buried the key near the lighthouse. It's far enough away that I expect we'll never have to worry about this room being opened again.

I heard voices from the room last night... a little boy's voice actually, crying out about his sisters.  My application for a residency in Savannah has been approved, and frankly I'm quite grateful to be leaving the island.  I don't understand exactly what is happening here, but it seems as if everything has gone wrong since the murders. This will be my last note here.. I intend to secure the notes in the permanent files, for whoever may need to reference it in the future. 


My only warning, which I've relayed to the entire staff... stay out of the sealed room.  Nothing good will ever come of that place.
