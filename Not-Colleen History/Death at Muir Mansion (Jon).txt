Original Title: DD-5 Report of Disturbance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DD-5 Report of Public Disturbance~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Date: June 31, 1970
Time of Occurence (Approximate): 1900
Location: Muircastle Manor


Report: At 1930 hours a report came into the station via witness that a strange screaming was reported coming from the abondoned Muircastle Manor. After taking the drive up there I observed a few very strange things. 


After first entering the at 2003 hours building I noticed it was as if the walls had blood trickling down all sides. From the look of it I initially thought perhaps there were so many bodies on the floor above a mass murder had happened, again. Then suddenly it stopped. I couldn't believe my eyes. I climbed the stairs and then found what appeared to be a body. 


I checked for a pulse and found that the person was deceased. After removing the wallet of the victim I identified them as 27 year old Janice Colvil. A Oregon native from what her drivers license said. She also had a note in her wallet with direction to what appeared to be the manor and a message that said "If you're too scared I win the twenty". It seems the reports are true, the few tourists and visitors we get these days really are just yahoos chasing ghosts.


Her body was still warm placing approximate time of death at around 1900 from what I could tell. Her eyes were wide open, not sign of strangulation or hemorhaging. Her mouth was wide open as if stuck in this weird, silent scream. I then radioed in the report and the ME arrived to retrieve the body.
