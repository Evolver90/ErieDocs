Chief Coage, 
We asked you to come to Erie since you had investigative experience, yet we see no difference between before your arrival and now. The "occurences" continue and we are losing more and more tourists every year. At this rate we'll have nothing left when summer comes this year. Already buisnesses, some of which have been here thirty years, are packing up and leaving. I advise you get a handle on the situation and soon. As we both know there are no such things as ghosts and these pranks have gone on for almost three decades! How someone with you experience can not catch the group that seems to grow every year whom make these fake ghosts appear is beyond me.
