Phantom Theatre Company is an in character Opera House and Theatre on Erie Isle. 


The theatre was established is 1896 with heavy financial support from the wealthy residents of the island. The company moved into its current structured in 1906 and has operated continuously since that time.


Occasional rumors have floated around the island since the early twenties century, indicating occasional disappearances and other tragedies taking place in the theatre.  In 1932 the backstage structure collapsed during a performance of Macbeth, killing the entire cast and crew.  Thirty years later, a famous Hollywood actress, Mary O'Day, was performing when she was inexplicably attacked by another member of the cast, who slit her throat in front of the horrified audience.


More recently, the theatre has fallen on hard times as the economy of Erie Isle collapsed.  Rumor has it that multiple murders and disappearances have taken place, and the backstage areas are seriously avoided by all but the most dedicated theatergoers.


A number of RP positions exist at the theatre. Because this is not a formal faction, members of any faction can act in these roles.
