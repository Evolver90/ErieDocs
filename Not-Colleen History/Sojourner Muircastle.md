A distant cousin who never married, Sojourner Muircastle, moved to Erie to act as nanny to the five energetic Muircastle children.  She grew to love them deeply and when Gaston Muircastle attacked them, she fought him viciously to her last breath.  Now even in death she continues to care for them.  She is Cura Animarum, Soulkeeper to Gaston Jr [16], Julia [14], James [10], Anthony [8] and young Xavier [4]. Her form reflects the emotional energy their spirits impart---Fear, Rage, Pain, Sorrow.  If she does not maintain iron-willed control, the strength of these trapped souls' emotions are carried out in her actions toward the Erie Residents.
